# DataDrivenDining: Yelp review analytics for College Park Restaurants
In this project, I and a team of four acted as data analysts and consultants for a client looking to open a restaurant in College Park, MD. We analyzed Yelp Reviews for all restaurants in the area to come up with cuisine, location, and operating suggestions. Data included restaurant name, review text, and more. 
Libraries used: Pandas, MatPlotLib, NLTK.
